# "Cultures, Events, Nations, Journals"

Current version is 0.0.1.

**CENJ** is an experimental mod for Victoria 3 that I am creating for personal use.

Please note: this mod **will** cause the game to slow down significant towards the mid-game due to it creating many more divisions in the game's POPs. This is unavoidable at present.

# Mod Scope

"Cultures, Events, Nations, Journals" are the main scope of this mod.

*defines* will be modified to increase assimilation, conversion and create more cultural turmoil and migration waves to the new world.

*on_actions* will be used to convert cultures automatically.

Until Paradox fixes Closed Borders law preventing internal migration or a better workaround is found; *Closed Borders will function like Migration Control and Migration Control will function like Open Borders.*

# Notes

Version numbers will work as x.x.x = major.moderate.minor changes.

*Disclaimer: I will use other peoples' code and graphics if I believe I cannot improve upon it. There is no financial or reputational gain/loss from this. Time is precious.
