# Cultures, Events, Nations, Journals aka CENJ

Cultures, Events, Nations, Journals aka CENJ is an experimental mod for Victoria 3.

I have created this mod for two reasons; one is that I wanted to see if the migration wave mechanic would work better with more granular POPs. The second is that I just wanted to create a more varied experience for myself whilst playing - even if it does slow the game down!

The main idea for this came from a mod I started and never finished over a decade ago for Victoria II and the New Nations Mod for Victoria II.

# Features
*Current version number is 0.0.2 - see changelog for detailed changes*
## Current

- New cultures in the British Isles and continental Europe
- Migration waves larger and more frequent
- Closed Borders works like Border Controls and Border Controls works like Open Borders law-wise because Closed Borders prevents internal migration at present.
- Increased the effect of discrimination on where POPs choose to move to (hopefully should counter-act the above change somewhat)
- Increased assimilation rate of POPs so that it doesn't run at a total snail's pace with all the separated POPs.

## Planned
- More cultures for the geographical definition of Europe
- Unique namelists for new cultures (currently using the closest cultures namelist)
- More nations
- Generic events based on inevitable historic events e.g. the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake
- Journals for added nations
- Create a decision tree that applies the mod's changes to minimise compatibility issues.

# Installation

To do.

# Compatibility

This mod is written for the latest* version of Victoria 3 - patch 1.2.7

Please note: this mod will inherently cause the game to run slower than vanilla, especially from the midgame onwards.

Most of the files within this mod will work as overrides so it should be compatible with other mods, the exception is the directories listed below where I have overwritten the default file. Any other mod you have installed won't be compatible with CENJ if it also overwrites these files.

## Overwritten files

- /common/history/pops/00_west_europe.txt

# Translation

This mod is availible in English.

Other languages will be added in the future, if you would like to add a translation or request one feel free to contact me.
