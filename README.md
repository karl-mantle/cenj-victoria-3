# Cultures, Events, Nations, Journals aka CENJ

Cultures, Events, Nations, Journals aka CENJ is an experimental mod for Victoria 3.

** Please note this mod is currently unbalanced and may be unstable **

The main idea for this came from a mod I started and never finished over a decade ago for Victoria II and the New Nations Mod for Victoria II.

## Current Features

### Countries

- 140+ new countries that can be formed or released throughout Europe and the New World
- Several new states

### Culture and Religion

- Dozens of new cultures
- Several new religions added
- Large pan-national cultures have been further broken down and will automatically assimilate into their parent culture
- New cultures for diasporas in the New World disconnected from their homeland
- Migration waves should now be larger and more frequent with discrimination having a larger effect
- Increased assimilation and conversion rates as well as chunk size

### Politics and Laws

- Added 1 new law with more planned
- Changed border laws so that Open Borders results in market-external migration via hidden events, Border Controls works like old Open Borders and Closed Borders works like Border Controls
- Changed cultural exclusion law so that it now discriminates anyone who doesn't also hold an accepted cultural trait
- Changes to several countries starting laws and political landscapes
- New characters

### Trade and Buildings

- Added several new trade goods
- Construction sector can now be entirely privatized (ports soon to follow...)
- Construction sector now relies on building materials rather than raw inputs and outputs mortgages and deeds (securities)
- Copper and Copper Mines added to world, some production methods of late game buildings now require copper
- Silver now a discoverable resource a la Gold Fields and a byproduct of Lead and Copper mines
- Copper, Silver and Gold are all tradeable resources that are used by the Finance Sector to create currency
- Currency can also be created through bonds and gilts (securities) with the adoption of fiat money
- Decentralised nations will use bartering and have no standards of currency

### Future Plans

- Balance the new trade goods and POP needs
- Unique namelists for new cultures
- More cultures and religions in other regions of the world
- Generic and nation-specific events
- Journals for new nations

## Installation

Download the contents of this project and place it in your Victoria 3 mods folder. On Windows this can be found in your documents folder "~/documents/paradox interactive/victoria 3/mods/".

## Compatibility

This mod is written for the latest* version of Victoria 3 - patch 1.2.7

Please note: this mod will inherently cause the game to run slower than vanilla, especially from the midgame onwards.

Most of the files within this mod will work as seperate overwrites so it should be compatible with other mods, the exception is the directories listed below where I have overwritten the vanilla file(s). Any other mod you have installed won't be compatible with CENJ if it also overwrites these vanilla files without making a compatibility patch.
