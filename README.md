# Cultures, Events, Nations, Journals aka CENJ

Cultures, Events, Nations, Journals aka CENJ is an experimental mod for Victoria 3.

** Please note this mod is currently unbalanced and may be unstable **

The main idea for this came from a mod I started and never finished over a decade ago for Victoria II and the New Nations Mod for Victoria II.

## Current and Upcoming Features

"*" is applied to upcoming features.

### Countries

- 150+ new countries that can be released, formed or exist at game-start.
- Several new states including Brabant, Liguria*, Verona*, Greater London*, East Midlands*, etc.

### Culture and Religion

- 40+ new cultures including German, Italian, French minors and various other minor cultures.
- Examples include: Franconian, Baltic German, Sicilian, Irish-American, Pontic Greek, etc.
- New religions such as Anglican* and Reformed (Calvinist)*
- Italian, French and German cultures have been balkanised somewhat and will merge into their national and pan-national cultures, e.g. Low Saxons > North German > German provided they exist.
- New cultures for diasporas in the New World disconnected from their homeland
- Migration waves should now be larger and more frequent with discrimination having a larger effect
- Increased assimilation and conversion rates as well as chunk size

- Copper, Silver and Gold are all tradeable resources that are used by countries Mints to create currency
- Currency is used by the Finance Sector to create securities which satiate POPs financial product needs

## Installation

Download the contents of this project and place it in your Victoria 3 mods folder. On Windows this can be found in your documents folder "~/documents/paradox interactive/victoria 3/mods/".

## Compatibility

This mod is written for the latest* version of Victoria 3 - patch 1.3.1

Please note: this mod will inherently cause the game to run slower than vanilla, especially from the midgame onwards.

Most of the files within this mod will work as seperate overwrites so it should be compatible with other mods, the exception is the directories listed below where I have overwritten the vanilla file(s). Any other mod you have installed won't be compatible with CENJ if it also overwrites these vanilla files without making a compatibility patch.

### Overwritten vanilla files and directories

- This will need to be updated further. It is not correct at present.
