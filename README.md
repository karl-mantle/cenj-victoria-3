# Cultures, Events, Nations, Journals aka CENJ

Cultures, Events, Nations, Journals aka CENJ is an experimental mod for Victoria 3.

I have created this mod for two reasons; one is that I wanted to see if the migration wave mechanic would work better with more granular POPs. The second is that I just wanted to create a more varied experience for myself whilst playing - even if it does slow the game down!

The main idea for this came from a mod I started and never finished over a decade ago for Victoria II and the New Nations Mod for Victoria II.

# Features

## Current

- 140 new countries in North America and Europe
- New cultures in the New World, Europe and the Middle East
- Migration waves larger and more frequent
- New World diaspora cultures with automatic assimilation and homelands e.g. Irish POPs in the USA will assimilate to Irish-American
- Closed Borders works as Migration Controls because there's no way to close only external borders
- Migration Controls works as Open Borders
- Open Borders now will result in POPs who have a lower SOL in neighbouring countries border states moving to the Open Border's countries border states e.g. some POPs in Spanish-owned Catalonia may move to Languedoc if the average SOL is greater in French-owned Languedoc.
- Cultural Exclusion now discriminates against anyone not holding a cultural trait
- Increased the effect of discrimination on where POPs choose to move to (hopefully should counter-act the above change somewhat)
- Increased assimilation rate and chunk size of POPs that assimilate so that it doesn't run at a total snail's pace with all the separated POPs.

## Planned
- More cultures for the geographical definition of Europe
- Unique namelists for new cultures (currently using the closest cultures namelist)
- More nations
- Generic events based on inevitable historic events e.g. the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake
- Journals for added nations
- Create a decision tree that applies the mod's changes to minimise compatibility issues.

# Installation

Download the contents of this project and place it in your Victoria 3 mods folder. On Windows this can be found in your documents folder "~/documents/paradox interactive/victoria 3/mods/".

# Compatibility

This mod is written for the latest* version of Victoria 3 - patch 1.2.7

Please note: this mod will inherently cause the game to run slower than vanilla, especially from the midgame onwards.

Most of the files within this mod will work as seperate overwrites so it should be compatible with other mods, the exception is the directories listed below where I have overwritten the vanilla file(s). Any other mod you have installed won't be compatible with CENJ if it also overwrites these vanilla files without making a compatibility patch.

## Overwrite files

There are overwrites to migration and culture laws, a number of vanilla cultures and ____. They are in seperate files, with the exception of the following:

### Overwritten vanilla files

- /common/history/pops/00_west_europe.txt
- /common/history/pops/01_south_europe.txt
- /common/history/pops/02_east_europe.txt
- /common/history/pops/09_central_asia.txt
- /common/history/pops/14_siberia.txt
