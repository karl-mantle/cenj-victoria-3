# Working Title: CENJ

Working Title: CENJ is an experimental mod for Victoria 3.

** Please note this mod is currently unbalanced and may be unstable **

This is the first mod that I've created for a Paradox game in over a decade, and that was only a small Victoria II mod that added a couple of new tags. All feedback is welcome!

This mod was originally titled Cultures, Events, Nations, Journals.

## Installation

Download the contents of this project and place it in your Victoria 3 mods folder. On Windows this can be found in your documents folder "~/documents/paradox interactive/victoria 3/mods/".

## Compatibility

This mod is written for the latest* version of Victoria 3 - patch 1.3.1

Please note: this mod will inherently cause the game to run slower than vanilla, especially from the midgame onwards.

Most of the files within this mod will work as seperate overwrites so it should be compatible with other mods, the exception is the directories listed below where I have overwritten the vanilla file(s). Any other mod you have installed won't be compatible with CENJ if it also overwrites these vanilla files without making a compatibility patch.

### Overwritten vanilla files and directories

- This will need to be updated further. It is not correct at present.
