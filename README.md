# CENJ

Current version is 0.0.1.

This is an experimental mod for Victoria 3 that I am creating for personal use. Please note, this mod will cause the game to slow down significant towards the mid-game due to it creating many more divisions in the game's POPs. This is unavoidable at present.

"Cultures, Events, Nations, Journals" are the main scope of this mod.

Defines will be modified to increase assimilation, conversion and create more cultural turmoil and migration waves to the new world.

on_actions will be used to convert cultures automatically.

Until Paradox fixes Closed Borders law preventing internal migration or a better workaround is found; Closed Borders will function like Migration Control and Migration Control will function like Open Borders.

Version numbers will work as x.x.x = major.moderate.minor changes.

Disclaimer: I will use other peoples' code and graphics if I believe I cannot improve upon it. There is no financial or reputational gain/loss from this. Time is precious.
