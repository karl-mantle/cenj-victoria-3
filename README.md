# cenj (Working Title)

cenj (Working Title) is an experimental mod for Victoria 3.

** Please note this mod is currently unbalanced and may be unstable **

This is the first mod that I've created for a Paradox game in over a decade, and that was only a small Victoria II mod that added a couple of new tags. All feedback is welcome!

This mod was originally titled Cultures, Events, Nations, Journals.

For a list of features and an update changelog, please see the documentation folder within this mod.

## Installation

Download the contents of this project and place it in your Victoria 3 mods folder. On Windows this can be found in your documents folder "~/documents/paradox interactive/victoria 3/mods/".

## Compatibility

This mod is written for the latest* version of Victoria 3 - patch 1.3.6

Please note: this mod will inherently cause the game to run slower than vanilla, especially from the midgame onwards (around the 1860s...).

This mod should be fully compatible with any cosmetic / GUI mods.

Any other kind of mod would have to be looked at on a case-by-case basis.

## Translation

This mod is available in English.

Other languages will be added in the future, if you would like to add a translation or request one feel free to contact me. 

## Credits

A full list of credits can be found in ~/documentation/credits.md.

### Licence

You can (re-)use any part of this mod that I personally created in whatever way you want.

### Notes
